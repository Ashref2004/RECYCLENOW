# ♻️ RecycleNow - Hackathon Project | وهران 2025

**A bold initiative from the heart of Tissemsilt!**  
This is **RecycleNow**, a front-end web app that empowers individuals to take action against environmental waste. Born out of passion and innovation, it was built and submitted as part of the **2025 Oran Hackathon**.

> 💔 Unfortunately, despite the quality and impact of the project, it didn't win — not due to lack of merit, but because of regional bias that too often overshadows true talent. But we rise anyway!
